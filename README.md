### Koalacards (Hayden)

ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! My name is Hayden (he/him), and I am a fourth-year computer science and mathematics major (with a minor in microeconomics) at school in Boston. After graduation, I will be a software engineer at a Fortune 500 company doing python-related platform engineeering!

#### Projects

I typically code all of my projects in Python, mostly surrounding Discord Bots and python packages. All of my projects have extensive readme and python documentation so feel free to check out my source code!

Here are my most notable projects:

âœ¨[pytoontown](https://github.com/Koalacards/pytoontown) is a Python API wrapper for the popular private servers of the game Toontown (Toontown Rewritten, Toontown Corporate Clash). This can be used to get live information about the game into your python applications. Find more information on the [PyPi Page](https://pypi.org/project/pytoontown/)!

âœ¨[Sus-O-Meter](https://github.com/Koalacards/Sus-O-Meter) is a simple discord bot that cross-references the last 1000 messages in a discord channel to a "sus list" (based on the among us meme) to determine who is the most sus in a server! This bot has been officially verified by discord and is in well over 400 servers! This is a really good repo to look at for anyone who is picking up python and discord bots and wants something simple to look at!

âœ¨[Plotter](https://github.com/Koalacards/Plotter) is a much more complex discord bot that uses the matplotlib, numpy, and other python packages and allows any discord users to create complex datasets (with random options) and create graphs/plots with those datasets! The bot is really intuitive to use, and is currently being worked on to add more graphs and features for users!

#### Other Work

Besides my projects, I have completed two co-ops (six month internships) at tech companies; one at a smaller company doing half-QA half-engineering (QA with Selenium, engineering on a data API using Python) and one at a much larger Fortune 500 company doing platform engineering for python applications using python, shell, yaml, and dockerfile (I will be returning to this position after graduating). I am additionally a TA at my school, and help students land internships by reading resumes and conducting mock interviews, so feel free to reach out if you have any questions about the tech industry!
